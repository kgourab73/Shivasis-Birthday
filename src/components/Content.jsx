        Hi everyone! I’m <i>Shivashis</i>, and I’ve got some BIG news for you
        all! 💼💪 I just got PLACED (yes, I know, it’s about time 🤓), but let’s
        get to the more important stuff— MY BIRTHDAY is coming up on October
        20th! 🎂🥳 Now, you know how we celebrate birthdays, right? Forget the
        cake, candles, and sweet stuff. We’re going straight to the REAL
        TRADITION— BIRTHDAY BEATDOWN mode! 💀 I’m inviting all my dearest
        friends (aka future enemies after this day 🤣) to join me for a day of…
        UNLEASHING YOUR INNER WARRIOR 😈🔥. That means, everyone is required to
        bring:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>🔴 Your strongest belt (the thicker, the better), </p>
      <p>
        🔴 A well-aimed chappal (bonus points for precision 😜),Sturdy sandals
        (because nothing says love like a solid whack),
      </p>
      <p>
        🔴And for the elite few— an epic wooden stick (to deliver that final
        blow ⚔️).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The goal? Turn me into a human piñata 🎯🎉, and if I’m still standing
        after this, you haven’t tried hard enough! 😆 Remember: the harder you
        hit, the more blessings you’re sending me for my future career 🤕🙏. So
        come ready to bring your A-game 💥. It’s gonna be a festival of friendly
        brutality 😅— because nothing says "Happy Birthday" like being chased
        around by your friends with weapons of choice! 🤣
      </p>
